Angular Photoalbum

# Database setup
 1. First run api/database/database.sql to create the database and tables
 2. Then run create-user.sql to create the user and give it permissions on the database

 When there are changes to the DB schema file, you only need to run step 1 - step 2 (create user) only needs to be run once.

## To get up and running:
cd /path/to/project
bower install
npm install

`If that doesn't work you probably miss some dependencies:`

sudo apt-get ruby-full rubygems  
sudo gem install sass  
sudo gem install compass  
npm install -g bower  
npm install -g grunt-cli  

# Installing and using the Yeoman generator

npm install -g yo  
npm install -g generator-angular  

yo angular:controller testCtrl  
yo angular:route testroute  
yo angular:view testView  
etc...
